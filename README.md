# Parallel-Character-Counting

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses the variable length coding table to encode
the characters in the file. The variable-length coding table is obtained by evaluating the frequency of each 
character in the files. This project aims to count the number of different characters in each file using multiple 
threads, which is the first step to construct the variable-length coding table for Huffman coding.
There are four specific objectives to this project:

• To familiarize yourself with the Linux pthreads package for writing multi-threaded programs.\
• To learn how to parallelize a program.\
• To learn how to write the results concurrently.\
• To learn how to program for performance.
